## üöÄ **Project Overview**

**Ohmies** is an Android application designed as part of the **IEEE Innovation Hub (IH) project**. It focuses on **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device scanning**, allowing users to discover nearby BLE peripherals like **ESP32 modules** and other BLE-enabled devices seamlessly.

This project acts as a base module for larger IoT ecosystems integrating BLE for **smart environments, wearable sensors, and data acquisition systems**.
